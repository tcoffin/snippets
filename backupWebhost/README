This little script is for backing up a remotely hosted website and database.
It rsync's the data and grabs a dump of the database for every site listed in the sites.conf file.

usage:
backupRemote.pl <sites.conf files> <backup destination>

The format of sites is as follows:
<ssh hostname>,<directory of files on ssh host>,[database host],[database name],[database login],[database password]

each line of sites.conf is a different site to backup.
Database information is optional. Database host is accessed from ssh hostname and the database is dumped using mysqldump.
The assumption is that you've set up your ssh authorized keys properly (i.e. you can see to <ssh hostname> without a password).

Local dependancies:
perl 5
ssh 
rsync
gzip
tar

Remote dependancies:
mysqldump
